# node-red-contrib-mespeak
A Node Red node for text-to-speech conversion (without dependencies).

## Install
Run the following npm command in your Node-RED user directory (typically ~/.node-red):
```
npm install bartbutenaers/node-red-contrib-mespeak
```
Using this command, the node is installed directly from Github.  It is not published on NPM since the quality of the mespeak voice is poor, in comparison to other (cloud-service based) nodes.
